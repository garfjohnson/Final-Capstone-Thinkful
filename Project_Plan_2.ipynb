        "*   Once it is tuned to be as accurate as possible, it can provide value by comparing its predictions with betting odds, and identify potentially profitable bets.\n",
        "* Iâ€™ll implement a neural network using Keras and Tensorflow to create a classifier for win and loss predictions. Based on my research, this will most likely be the most accurate method, but I will try a variety of supervised classification models to compare against.\n",
