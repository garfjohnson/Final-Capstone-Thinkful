        "*   Once it is tuned to be as accurate as possible, it can provide value by comparing its predictions with betting odds, and identify potentially profitable bets.\n",
        "* I’ll implement a neural network using Keras and Tensorflow to create a classifier for win and loss predictions. Based on my research, this will most likely be the most accurate method, but I will try a variety of supervised classification models to compare against.\n",
        "* The biggest challenge will be tuning for accuracy. Vegas experts hover around 70% accuracy and a coin flip achieves 50%, so the 70% mark should be a good target."
